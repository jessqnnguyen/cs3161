-- BUILDING LISTS

[1, 2, 3]

-- a string is just a list of characters in HS hence it renders as a string in HS
['a', 'b', 'c']

-- let's use cons! 
[] -- Nil operator
1 : []
1 : 2 : 3 : []

-- this doesn't work - only lists of one data type! (obviously)
-- [1, 'a']

-- trying out lexer!
-- it ignores 'blah'
lexer "((((blah)"
